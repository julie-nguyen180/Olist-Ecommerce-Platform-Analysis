- **Interactive Filtering**: Time, location, and cluster-based exploration

## 🧮 Tech Stack

- **Power BI, Power Query**: Data modelling, DAX measures, and visualisation

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🏬 Platform Performance
- Active sellers (+1.78%) and customers (+3.31%) are growing steadily, with a notable 6.23% spike in products sold.
- Order volumes are rising, but AOV has dropped by 3.22%, suggesting a shift toward smaller or lower-priced baskets.
- While the average customer rating remains strong (4.28), a slight MoM decline (-0.08) may signal early fulfilment or satisfaction issues under growing transaction load.
